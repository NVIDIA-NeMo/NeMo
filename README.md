## AVLM

### Data

- **AVLM Datasets**


NeMo Transformer-based LLMs and MMs utilize [NVIDIA Transformer
Engine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine) for FP8 training on
NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while leveraging [NVIDIA Megatron
Core](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/megatron/core) for
scaling Transformer model training.

NeMo LLMs can be aligned with state-of-the-art methods such as SteerLM,
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback (RLHF). See [NVIDIA NeMo
Aligner](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner) for more information.

In addition to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), NeMo also supports the
latest parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as LoRA,
P-Tuning, Adapters, and IA3. Refer to the [NeMo Framework User
Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/sft_peft/index.html)
for the full list of supported models and techniques.

## LLMs and MMs Deployment and Optimization

NeMo LLMs and MMs can be deployed and optimized with [NVIDIA NeMo
Microservices](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-microservices-early-access).

## Speech AI

NeMo ASR and TTS models can be optimized for inference and deployed for
production use cases with [NVIDIA Riva](https://developer.nvidia.com/riva).

## NeMo Framework Launcher

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> NeMo Framework Launcher is compatible with NeMo version 1.0 only. [NeMo-Run](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Run) is recommended for launching experiments using NeMo 2.0.

[NeMo Framework
Launcher](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Megatron-Launcher) is a
cloud-native tool that streamlines the NeMo Framework experience. It is
used for launching end-to-end NeMo Framework training jobs on CSPs and
Slurm clusters.

The NeMo Framework Launcher includes extensive recipes, scripts,
utilities, and documentation for training NeMo LLMs. It also includes
the NeMo Framework [Autoconfigurator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Megatron-Launcher#53-using-autoconfigurator-to-find-the-optimal-configuration),
which is designed to find the optimal model parallel configuration for
training on a specific cluster.

To get started quickly with the NeMo Framework Launcher, please see the
[NeMo Framework
Playbooks](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/playbooks/index.html).
The NeMo Framework Launcher does not currently support ASR and TTS
training, but it will soon.

## Get Started with NeMo Framework

Getting started with NeMo Framework is easy. State-of-the-art pretrained
NeMo models are freely available on [Hugging Face
Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?library=nemo&sort=downloads&search=nvidia)
and [NVIDIA
NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/models?query=nemo&orderBy=weightPopularDESC).
These models can be used to generate text or images, transcribe audio,
and synthesize speech in just a few lines of code.

We have extensive
[tutorials](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/en/stable/starthere/tutorials.html)
that can be run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or
with our [NGC NeMo Framework
Container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/nemo).
We also have
[playbooks](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/playbooks/index.html)
for users who want to train NeMo models with the NeMo Framework
Launcher.

For advanced users who want to train NeMo models from scratch or
fine-tune existing NeMo models, we have a full suite of [example
scripts](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/main/examples) that support
multi-GPU/multi-node training.

### Conda / Pip

Install NeMo in a fresh Conda environment:

```bash
conda create --name nemo python==3.10.12
conda activate nemo
```

#### Pick the right version

NeMo-Framework publishes pre-built wheels with each release.
To install nemo_toolkit from such a wheel, use the following installation method:

```bash
pip install "nemo_toolkit[all]"
```

If a more specific version is desired, we recommend a Pip-VCS install. From [NVIDIA/NeMo](github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo), fetch the commit, branch, or tag that you would like to install.  
To install nemo_toolkit from this Git reference `$REF`, use the following installation method:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo
cd NeMo
git checkout @${REF:-'main'}
pip install '.[all]'
```

#### Install a specific Domain

To install a specific domain of NeMo, you must first install the
nemo_toolkit using the instructions listed above. Then, you run the
following domain-specific commands:

```bash
pip install nemo_toolkit['all'] # or pip install "git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo@${REF:-'main'}#egg=nemo_toolkit[all]"
pip install nemo_toolkit['asr'] # or pip install "git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo@$REF#egg=nemo_toolkit[asr]"
pip install nemo_toolkit['nlp'] # or pip install "git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo@${REF:-'main'}#egg=nemo_toolkit[nlp]"
pip install nemo_toolkit['tts'] # or pip install "git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo@${REF:-'main'}#egg=nemo_toolkit[tts]"
pip install nemo_toolkit['vision'] # or pip install "git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo@${REF:-'main'}#egg=nemo_toolkit[vision]"
pip install nemo_toolkit['multimodal'] # or pip install "git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo@${REF:-'main'}#egg=nemo_toolkit[multimodal]"
```

### NGC PyTorch container

**NOTE: The following steps are supported beginning with 24.04 (NeMo-Toolkit 2.3.0)**

We recommended that you start with a base NVIDIA PyTorch container:
nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.01-py3.

If starting with a base NVIDIA PyTorch container, you must first launch
the container:

```bash
docker run \
  --gpus all \
  -it \
  --rm \
  --shm-size=16g \
  --ulimit memlock=-1 \
  --ulimit stack=67108864 \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:${NV_PYTORCH_TAG:-'nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.01-py3'}
```

From [NVIDIA/NeMo](github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo), fetch the commit/branch/tag that you want to install.  
To install nemo_toolkit including all of its dependencies from this Git reference `$REF`, use the following installation method:

```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo
cd NeMo
git checkout ${REF:-'main'}
bash reinstall.sh --library all
```

## NGC NeMo container

NeMo containers are launched concurrently with NeMo version updates.
NeMo Framework now supports LLMs, MMs, ASR, and TTS in a single
consolidated Docker container. You can find additional information about
released containers on the [NeMo releases
page](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/releases).

To use a pre-built container, run the following code:

```bash
docker run \
  --gpus all \
  -it \
  --rm \
  --shm-size=16g \
  --ulimit memlock=-1 \
  --ulimit stack=67108864 \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:${NV_PYTORCH_TAG:-'nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:25.02'}
```

## Future Work

The NeMo Framework Launcher does not currently support ASR and TTS
training, but it will soon.
