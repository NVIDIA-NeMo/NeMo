# NeMo Blog Posts and Announcements

[NVIDIA NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) is a conversational AI toolkit that supports multiple domains such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Text to Speech generation (TTS), Speaker Recognition (SR), Diarization (SDR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Neural Machine translation (NMT) and much more. [NVIDIA RIVA](https://developer.nvidia.com/riva) has long been the toolkit that enables efficient deployment of NeMo models. In recent months, [NeMo Megatron](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-megatron-early-access) supports training and inference on large language models (upto 1 trillion parameters !).

As NeMo becomes capable of more advanced tasks, such as [p-tuning / prompt tuning of NeMo Megatron models](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/stable/tutorials/nlp/Multitask_Prompt_and_PTuning.ipynb), [domain adaptation of ASR models using Adapter modules](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/stable/tutorials/asr/asr_adapters/ASR_with_Adapters.ipynb), [customizable generative TTS models](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/stable/tutorials/tts/Inference_DurationPitchControl.ipynb) and much more, we introduce this website as a collection of blog posts and announcements for:

* Technical deep dives of NeMo's capabilities
* Presenting state-of-the-art research results
* Announcing new capabilities and domains of research that our team will work on.
