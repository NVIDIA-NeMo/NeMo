# [A Toolbox for Construction and Analysis of Speech Datasets](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=oJ0oHQtAld)

Automatic Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech systems are primarily trained
in a supervised fashion and require high-quality, accurately labeled speech datasets.
In this work, we examine common problems with speech data and introduce
a toolbox for the construction and interactive error analysis of speech datasets.
The construction tool is based on Kürzinger et al. work, and, to the best of our
knowledge, the dataset exploration tool is the world’s first open-source tool of this
kind. We demonstrate how to apply these tools to create a Russian speech dataset
and analyze existing speech datasets (Multilingual LibriSpeech, Mozilla Common
Voice). The tools are open sourced as a part of the NeMo framework.
