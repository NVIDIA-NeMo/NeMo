# [NeMo Forced Aligner and its application to word alignment for subtitle generation](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2023/rastorgueva23_interspeech.html)

We present NeMo Forced Aligner (NFA): an efficient and accurate forced aligner which is part of the NeMo conversational AI open-source toolkit. NFA can produce token, word, and segment-level alignments, and can generate subtitle files for highlighting words or tokens as they are spoken. We present a demo which shows this functionality, and demonstrate that NFA has the best word alignment accuracy and speed of alignment generation compared with other aligners.
