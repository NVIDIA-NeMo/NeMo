Checkpoints
===========

The ASR collection has checkpoints of several models trained on various datasets. These models can be accessed via
the :code:`from_pretrained()` method inside the ASR Model class.

Note that these checkpoints are obtainable via NGC `NeMo Automatic Speech Recognition collection <https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/models/nvidia:nemospeechmodels>`_.
