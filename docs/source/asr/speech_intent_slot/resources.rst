Resources and Documentation
---------------------------

If you are a beginner to NeMo, consider trying out the 
`ASR with NeMo <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/tutorials/asr/ASR_with_NeMo.ipynb>`_ 
tutorial. This and most other tutorials can be run on Google Colab by specifying the link to the 
notebooks' GitHub pages on Colab.

If you are looking for information about a particular ASR model, or would like to find out more 
about the model architectures available in the ``nemo_asr`` collection, refer to the 
`ASR Models <../models.html>`__ page.

Example of Speech Intent Classification and Slot Filling can be found `here <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/examples/slu/speech_intent_slot/README.md>`_.

Information about how to load model checkpoints (either local files or pretrained ones from NGC), 
as well as a list of the checkpoints available on NGC are located on the `Checkpoints <./results.html>`__ 
page.

Documentation regarding the configuration files specific to SLU can be found in the 
`Configuration Files <./configs.html>`__ page.
