Speech Dataset Processor
========================

Speech Dataset Processor (SDP) is a toolkit to make it easy to:
1. write code to process a new dataset, minimizing the amount of boilerplate code required.
2. share the steps for processing a speech dataset. Sharing processing steps can be as easy as sharing a YAML file.

More information about it can be found `here <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/main/tools/speech_dataset_processor>`_.
