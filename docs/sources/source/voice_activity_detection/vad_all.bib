    abstract = {Freesound is an online collaborative sound database where people with diverse interests share recorded sound samples under Creative Commons licenses. It was started in 2005 and it is being maintained to support diverse research projects and as a service to the overall research and artistic community. In this demo we want to introduce Freesound to the multimedia community and show its potential as a research resource. We begin describing some general aspects of Freesound, its architecture and functionalities, and then explain potential usages that this framework has for research applications.},
