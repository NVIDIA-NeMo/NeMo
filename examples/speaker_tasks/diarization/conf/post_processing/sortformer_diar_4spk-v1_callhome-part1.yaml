# Postprocessing parameters for timestamp outputs from speaker diarization models.
# This speaker diarization postprocessing scheme is inspired by the postprocessing procedure in the following paper:
# Medennikov, Ivan, et al. "Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection: a Novel Approach for Multi-Speaker Diarization in a Dinner Party Scenario." (2020).
# These parameters were optimized on CallHome Dataset from the NIST SRE 2000 Disc8, especially from the part1 (callhome1) specified in: Kaldi, “Kaldi x-vector recipe v2,” https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/blob/master/egs/callhome_diarization/v2/run.sh
parameters: 
  onset: 0.53  # Onset threshold for detecting the beginning of a speech segment
  offset: 0.49  # Offset threshold for detecting the end of a speech segment
  pad_onset: 0.23  # Adds the specified duration at the beginning of each speech segment
  pad_offset: 0.01  # Adds the specified duration at the end of each speech segment
  min_duration_on: 0.42  # Removes short speech segments if the duration is less than the specified minimum duration
  min_duration_off: 0.34  # Removes short silences if the duration is less than the specified minimum duration
