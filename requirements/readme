NeMo can be installed in a number of ways. We can install just the core, collections, and even other tools such as
text normlization and inverse normalization.

How can we install these? From the NeMo folder we can run:

  - pip install [--editable] .
  - pip install [--editable] ".[all]"

In either case, we install all of the code inside the nemo folder. Even though we require librosa for speech tasks, if
we only install core, we can still run `from nemo.collections.asr import *`. It will crash saying librosa is not installed,
but the key is that the code in the asr collection is still "installed".

Is it possible to create a version of NeMo that can minimize our dependencies? Can we create collections or parts of the
code base that only relies upon pip packages that are already in our pytorch container?
This will make it easier for other teams to use standalone tools like our text normalization tools, or for other teams
to depend on only torch portions of NeMo.

My proposal is to split NeMo into two parts that can coexist:

  - Parts that depend only on torch
  - Parts that depend on ligthning, hydra, omegaconf, etc

These parts I envision are:

  - pip install .
    - The new NeMo "core"
    - Allows for simple utilities: logging, exportable
  - pip install ".[text_normalization]"
    - The text normalization tool
    - We can have other tools here as well
  - pip install ".[torch_all]"
    - A collection of our torch modules
  - pip install ".[torch_tts]"
    - A collection of our torch modules
  - pip install ".[lightning]"
    - Our current "core" which includes ModelPT
  - pip install ".[lightning_asr]"
    - Our current asr collection. We can enable `pip install ".[asr]"` here as well for backwards compatibility
  - pip install ".[all]"
    - Installs all requirements. Everything in NeMo is expected to work here

ToDos:
  - Split any lightning away from new core
  - Split all utils into sections for lightning and sections not for lightning
  - Rework and minimize all requirement files
  - Create new torch_tts collection
