After pre-training our encoder in this way, we can use it in a CTC or RNNT ASR model.\n","\n","The approach we will use for pre-training our models is represented in the following diagram:\n","\n"," ![SSL diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/main/tutorials/asr/images/contrastive_ssl.png)\n","\n","We first mask parts of our input using SpecAugment.  The model is then trained to solve a contrastive task of distinguishing the latent representation of the masked time steps from several sampled distractors. Since our encoders also contain stride blocks which reduce the length of the inputs, in order to obtain target representations we combine several consecutive time steps. They are then passed through a quantizer, which has been found to help with contrastive pre-training."],"metadata":{"id":"FGIVHjS1YEPw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Preparing our data"],"metadata":{"id":"i5XZWBnTf1pT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"38aYTCTIlRzh"},"source":["## Downloading dataset\n","\n","In order to demonstrate how to pre-train the model, we will use the AN4 dataset.
