    "\n",
    "The simulator creates a speech session using utterances from a desired number of speakers. The simulator first selects the LibriSpeech speaker IDs that will be used for the current session, and sets speaker dominance values for each speaker to determine how often each speaker will talk in the session. The session is then constructed by iterating through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The next speaker is selected (which could be the same speaker again with some probability, and which accounts for the speaker dominance values).\n",
    "* The sentence length is determined using a probability distribution, and an utterance of the desired length is then constructed by concatenating together (or truncating) LibriSpeech sentences corresponding to the desired speaker. Individual word alignments are used to truncate the last LibriSpeech sentence such that the entire utterance has the desired length.\n",
    "* Next, either the current utterance is overlapped with a previous utterance or silence is introduced before inserting the current utterance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simulator includes a multi-microphone far-field mode that incorporates synthetic room impulse response generation in order to simulate multi-microphone multispeaker sessions. When using RIR generation, the RIR is computed once per batch of sessions, and then each constructed utterance is convolved with the RIR in order to get the sound recorded by each microphone before adding the utterance to the audio session. In this tutorial, only near field sessions will be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulator also has a speaker enforcement mode which ensures that the correct number of speakers appear in each session, since it is possible that fewer than the desired number may be present since speaker turns are probabilistic. In speaker enforcement mode, the length of the session or speaker probabilites may be adjusted to ensure all speakers are included before the session finishes."
