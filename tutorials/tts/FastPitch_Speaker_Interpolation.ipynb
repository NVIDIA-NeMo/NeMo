    "### What is Speaker Interpolation in a Multi-speaker Text-to-speech Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a Multi-speaker Text-to-Speech (TTS) model that can generate speech in more than one speaker's voice, Speaker Interpolation is the process of synthesizing new synthetic **voices by combining two or more existing speaker voices** without the need for any further finetuning. Before we go in depths of the process let's understand why we need speaker interpolation?"

    "### Why we need speaker interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "To release any TTS model, trained on datasets where the speakers do not want speech to be generated in their voice, speaker interpolation is important. This technique can be used to replace the original speaker's in the pretrained model with the interpolated synthetic speakers. This work would solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique can be used to generate large multi-speaker dataset for training Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models or voice conversion models. It enables users to create an infinite number of speaker voices. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use speaker interpolation for achieving varying multi-dialect or multi-emotional voices in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. They may\n",
    "be used for personalizing speech and generating speech with specific voice characteristics in speech synthesis systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of self-supervised learning (SSL), speaker interpolation can be used for negative sampling. In addition to the above use cases, speaker interpolation can be used for data augmentation as well."
