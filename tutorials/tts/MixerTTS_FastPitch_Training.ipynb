    "Mixer-TTS is non-autoregressive model for mel-spectrogram generation. The model is based on the MLP-Mixer architecture adapted for speech synthesis. It contains pitch and duration predictors, with the latter being trained with an unsupervised TTS alignment framework.\n",
    "For more details about model, please refer to the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03584).\n",

    "### FastPitch\n",
    "\n",
    "FastPitch is  a fully-parallel text-to-speech model based on FastSpeech, conditioned on fundamental frequency contours. The model predicts pitch contours and duration of each token during inference. Conditioning on frequency contours improves the overall quality of synthesized speech. This implementation of FastPitch leverages an unsupervised speech-text [aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10447) which is trained end-to-end as part of the TTS pipeline. This makes the model more robust to errors on long utterances. For more details about model, please refer to the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06873). The original implementation of FastPitch can be found [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/SpeechSynthesis/FastPitch).\n",
