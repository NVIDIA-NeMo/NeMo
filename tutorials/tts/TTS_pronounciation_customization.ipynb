    "## Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern **text-to-speech** (TTS) models can learn pronunciations from raw text input and its corresponding audio data.\n",
    "Sometimes, however, it is desirable to customize pronunciations, for example, for domain-specific terms. As a result, many TTS systems use grapheme and phonetic input during training to directly access and correct pronunciations at inference time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) and [ARPABET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPABET) are the most common phonetic alphabets. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to customize pronunciations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. pass word's phonetic as an input to the TTS model, note that the request-time overrides are best suited for one-off adjustments\n",
    "2. configure TTS model with the desired domain-specific terms using custom phonetic dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods require users to convert graphemes into phonemes (G2P). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### All words for G2P purposes could be divided into the following groups:\n",
    "* *known* words - words that are present in the model's phonetic dictionary\n",
    "* *out-of-vocabulary (OOV)* words - words that are missing from the model's phonetic dictionary. \n",
    "* *[heteronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronym_(linguistics)* - words with the same spelling but different pronunciations and/or meanings, e.g., *bass* (the fish) and *bass* (the musical instrument).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important NeMo flags:\n",
    "* `your_spec_generator_model.vocab.g2p.phoneme_dict` - model's phonetic dictionary that maps words to their phonetic form, e.g., [ARPABET-based CMU Dictionary](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/r1.14.0/scripts/tts_dataset_files/cmudict-0.7b_nv22.10) or [IPA-based CMU Dictionary](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/r1.14.0/scripts/tts_dataset_files/ipa_cmudict-0.7b_nv22.10.txt)\n",
    "* `your_spec_generator_model.vocab.g2p.ignore_ambiguous_words`: if is set to **True**, words with more than one phonetic representation in the pronunciation dictionary are ignored. This flag is relevant to heteronyms and non-heteronym words with multiple valid phonetic forms in the dictionary, for example, due to accent variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "TTS models take text in grapheme form, then convert all known unambiguous words into phonetic form during preprocessing. The rest of the words (OOV and words with multiple dictionary entries) are kept as graphemes, and the TTS model uses context clues from the sentence to predict an appropriate pronunciation for such words.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the desired pronunciation, we need to add a new entry to the models' phonetic dictionary. If the target word is already in the dictionary, we need to remove the default pronunciation so that only the target pronunciation is present. "
